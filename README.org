* magit-stats
** What is this package?
A (still under development) git statistics report generator that can
be use as an individual CLI Tool or called from inside Emacs,
hopefully from magit.

*IMPORTANT: this is a node npx package, if you wan't to use it inside EMACS
scroll to the "Emacs Usage" section bellow.*

Here's a demo of the report:
[[./doc/demo.png]]

** Requirements
You need to have ~node@latest~ installed in your system and the ~npx~ tool.

Just check if you have it issuing the command: ~npx --version~.

** Basic Usage
Navigate to your git folder and issue:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npx magit-stats
#+END_SRC

And that's it! A new ~git-stats.html~ file is generated with your
repository statistics and will be automatically opened.

** Advanced Usage
You can get all options of this cli tool by issuing ~npx magit-stats --help~.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
