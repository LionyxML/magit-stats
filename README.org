A very early attempt of writing some sort of git statistics in order

- [X] Calculate commits by author

- [ ] Calculate commits by week day

- [ ] Calculate commits per day hour

- [ ] Calculate repository size

- [ ] Calculate initial commit date

- [ ] Calculate last commit date

- [ ] Use CLI tool to determine input dir, output dir and output format

- [ ] Create exporter to JSON on stdout

- [ ] Create exporter to JSON file

- [ ] Create exporter do HTML

- [ ] Create exporter to org file

- [ ] Create exporter to md file

- [ ] Make elisp package that calls the node function passing the project folder as argument
